**[variable and data type](/variable.py)**

Variable
=========================
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Rule to Declare variable
=========================
1) Variable names can contain only letters numbers and underscores
2) Space are not allowed in variable but underscore can be used
3) Avoid using Python keyword and function name as variable
4) Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

## Most commonly used function in string operation are    
    len() # to determine the string length
    title() # make uppercase first character of each word
    upper() # convert string to upper case
    strip() # Remove space 
    lstrip() # Remove space form left side
    rstrip() # Remove space form right side
    split() # split string and return it in list types
    join() # method takes all item in an iterable and join them into one string
    count() # count string character
    replace()
    startwith()
